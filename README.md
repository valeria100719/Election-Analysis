## Summary of the project points:

This project is developed in a different section:

1) Calculate the total number of votes cast

2) Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate

3) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won

4) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

To perform this analysis, we used Election_Results resources and Python 3.7.6 coding system.
Below you can find the link of the resources and the code generated.

The aim of this study was to generate a code that allowed us to analyze the total number of votes cast, the number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner. Moreover, the commission asked to complete the election commission has requested some additional data to confirm the voter turnout for each county, this includes:


·         The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

·         The county with the highest turnout

## Election Audit Results

### The analysis shows:

The total number of votes cast in the election were 369,465
There were 3 candidates:
Charles Casper Stockham
Diana Degette
Raymon Anthony Doane
The total number of votes for each candidate were:
Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total votes and 84,967 votes
Diana Degette received 73.9% of the total votes and 272,892 votes
Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the total votes and 11,606 votes
The election winner was:
Diana Degette, who received 73.9% of the total votes and 272,892 votes
 
 
## Election Audit Summary
 

### The final Analysis shows that:

There were 3 counties:

Jefferson

Denver

Arapahoe

The largest county was:

Denver, with almost 83% of the contribution.

This script can be used for any election, like senatorial districts and local elections. The script can be modifying by adding the option to add a graph on excel which will make the results much easier to read and interpret.
We can also change how the list on txt is read, maybe we can write code to perform the same analysis but at the end show the results in order of winner results, so for example to have:

1) Diana Degette received 73.9% of the total votes and 272,892 votes

2) Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total votes and 84,967 votes

3) Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the total votes and 11,606 votes

The same can be done with the county contribution, or we can merge the 2 data in one final analysis.
